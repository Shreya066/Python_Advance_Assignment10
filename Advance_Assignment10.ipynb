    "__ getattribute__ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. __ getattr__ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by __ getattribute__, but for this  __ getattribute__ and __ getattr__ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __ getattr__ returns a default value. So key difference is that __ getattr__ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
